<!-- Some random information for the user :)

JSX = JavaScript + XML.

Default Exports vs Named Exports:
Default = The name can be changed on the import side;
Named = The name cannot be changed on the import side.

Components:
Can be reused on other parts of the page.

Props:
An actual object with properties.
props: { author: "", content: ""}

Iteration:
Repeat (Reuse) something on the page / Repeating Structure.

State:
Variables that I want the component to monitor.

Imperative Programming:
What should be done (step-by-step).

Declarative Programming:
What are the conditions to obtain the final result.

Key on React:
Why the key needs to be unique? 
Because React uses the key to identify the component.
Components are rendered on 3 different places:
1 - When the state change;
2 - When the props change;
3 - When the 'father' component is rendered.
Needs to be unique to identify what component is being rendered and what alredy has rendered.
Why I can't use the index from array? 
Because if index change, the array is updated and values are changed.

Immutability:
The value of a variable cannot be changed.
A new variable is created with the new value.

React Closures:
Variables that are not defined inside the function, but are used inside the function.

Rest Operator:
Allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
Rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.

Spread Operator: 
Allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. 
In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.
Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements.
